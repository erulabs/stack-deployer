# nodestack-deployer

A small tool to run chef-client on multiple systems one at a time, followed by some configurable tests and some interactions with the Rackspace cloud. This is proof of concept and should probably be handled within Chef itself, however, it's fairly nifty and sort of fun :)

**Current Developers:** Seandon Mooy
